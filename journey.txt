1. Copied all files from HRR FEC repo and put into my service folder.

2. Installed all dependencies I know that I will need.
  -made sure to differenciate between my devDepen and my regular Depen.
  -webpack you either need a .babelrc file to hold presets or try to add them in as options in webpack.config.js (not sure which one worked, but did both and webpack was transpiling files correctly after).
  -webpack needs its webpack.config.js to know where to enter and output its files.

3. Create starting files in server and in client to make sure webpack is transpiling files correctly and server is able to render the files in the client.
